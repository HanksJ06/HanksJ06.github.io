											<h3>Year in review 2025</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
The first half of 2025 has been a period of growth, learning, and momentum toward the career in Information Technology that I’ve long envisioned. As a student at the University of Cincinnati, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology through the School of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, I’ve spent this year developing both technical skill and confidence in my direction. My chosen focus areas—Networking and Game Design/Simulation—have helped shape how I approach challenges, blending a deep appreciation for infrastructure with a creative mindset rooted in interactive experiences.

Exploring New Territory in the Classroom
This semester, my classes pushed me further than I expected—in the best way possible. I dove deep into the fundamentals of networking and simulations, learning how to better structure digital environments and optimize systems. These courses weren’t just about lectures—they were packed with labs, group work, and problem-solving sessions that helped connect theory to real-world practices. I’ve especially appreciated how the networking classes taught me to think critically about systems that often go unnoticed but are essential to our digital lives. At the same time, game design classes encouraged me to innovate and collaborate, reinforcing that my creative side has just as much place in IT as my logical one.

One of the most meaningful projects I tackled this semester was creating a basic interactive hub for a game—complete with a dialogue system, combat area, and wave spawner. It wasn’t just about building something cool; it was about learning how to turn an idea into a structured, playable system. That experience reminded me how much I enjoy creating digital spaces where people can engage and explore.

Making Time for Self-Improvement
Outside of class, I made an intentional effort to improve how I manage time and stay motivated. I committed to routines that kept me organized, whether it was through study calendars, staying active, or being more proactive about office hours and study groups. Living in a college dorm has brought its own challenges, but I’ve used the environment as a way to build independence—managing my own space, cooking for myself without access to an oven, and finding ways to keep my health in check while balancing everything else.

I’ve also worked on my communication skills, both online and in person. At times, I’ve struggled with shyness, but this semester I took small steps to change that—asking more questions in class, joining club events, and even helping classmates with their own projects when I could. These may seem like minor acts, but they’ve had a major impact on how confident I feel when collaborating or presenting.

Building Toward the Future
In many ways, this semester has felt like a warm-up for the exciting opportunities ahead. Over the summer, I’m preparing for a six-month work trip to Tokyo, Japan, alongside three others from my program. We’ll be living and working in the city, applying our IT skills in real-world settings, and experiencing life in a completely new culture. It’s a major step, and something I’ve been looking forward to for months. Between the cultural immersion and professional development, I know this experience will push me in ways that nothing else can.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to apply what I’ve learned in networking and game design in a practical context. Whether it’s assisting in systems management, supporting end users, or offering creative solutions, I want to be the kind of intern who shows up ready to contribute and learn.

Looking Ahead
As I look forward to the rest of 2025, I’m filled with anticipation for what’s next. I’ll continue refining my skills, strengthening my portfolio, and building connections within the industry. I'm especially excited to explore how IT intersects with global challenges and innovations, and to see how my interests—whether it’s creating games, optimizing networks, or mentoring peers—can contribute to that bigger picture.

Most of all, I’m proud of how far I’ve come. From my classes to my personal development, this semester has helped solidify my goals and affirm my place in the tech world. With a strong foundation behind me and new opportunities ahead, I’m ready to keep building, learning, and pushing myself to become the best IT professional I can be.
